Hi there! I'm Samuel from the pioneer batch of the Singapore University of
Technology and Design (SUTD). I love climbing mountains. I wanted to pursue my
passion, and that's how this project came about! Raymond, a very good friend of
mine, started this project with me.

As pioneers of SUTD, we wanted to do something for the school and something
we really loved. We gathered a group of individuals interested in mountaineering
and founded SUTD Mountaineering. We began generating ideas on what we could
do. 

Our initial idea was Mount Everest, but that proved to be very challenging
and dangerous, as we had limited time. That idea was rejected, but we remained
optimistic and began generating new ideas. Our new ideas were also rejected, and
there wasnâ€™t much progress. Soon, members started leaving the club.

At the same time, new members joined us. We tried our very best to keep the
vision alive. Our perseverance paid off and we finally got an idea approved: To
name a mountain after SUTD. We began raising funds and spreading awareness of
what we were doing and we managed to raise funds for our club and other 5th Rows
in SUTD.

On August 31st 2014, all 8 members successfully reached the top of an
**unnamed and unclimbed mountain, 6056m, 19868.77ft**. And yes, we named it
Mount SUTD! It should be on the maps in a few years.

Read about the adventure at <a
    href="http://sutdmountaineering.com/">www.sutdmountaineering.com</a>. I used
to be the webmaster there, but we have since handed it over to the next
generation of SUTD Mountaineers :)

Update on 2nd May 2016. The juniors are really doing well! They've grown to
quite a large size and have executed a trip to Vietnam and China since August 2016.  
They have also secured funding for a training climb in Kazakhstan. Most
recently, I heard that there's someone who wants to do a big climb. Perhaps the
time is now ripe for big things to happen ;)
