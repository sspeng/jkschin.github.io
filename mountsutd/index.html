<p>Hi there! I'm Samuel from the pioneer batch of the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I love climbing mountains. I wanted to pursue my passion, and that's how this project came about! Raymond, a very good friend of mine, started this project with me.</p>

<p>As pioneers of SUTD, we wanted to do something for the school and something we really loved. We gathered a group of individuals interested in mountaineering and founded SUTD Mountaineering. We began generating ideas on what we could do.</p> 

<p>Our initial idea was Mount Everest, but that proved to be very challenging and dangerous, as we had limited time. That idea was rejected, but we remained optimistic and began generating new ideas. Our new ideas were also rejected, and there wasnâ€™t much progress. Soon, members started leaving the club.</p>

<p>At the same time, new members joined us. We tried our very best to keep the vision alive. Our perseverance paid off and we finally got an idea approved: To name a mountain after SUTD. We began raising funds and spreading awareness of what we were doing and we managed to raise funds for our club and other 5th Rows in SUTD.</p>

<p>On August 31st 2015, all 8 members successfully reached the top of an <b>unnamed and unclimbed mountain, 6056m, 19868.77ft</b>. And yes, we named it Mount SUTD! It should be on the maps in a few years.</p>
