<p>Google released TensorFlow in November 2015 and I started using TensorFlow in
the last week of December 2015. That got me really excited as I just started
working on some Computer Vision problems. The first problem I did was about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F">Where's Wally?</a>, and
it definitely won't be the last project that I will be doing on Deep Learning.
Check out the list of <a href="\tensorflow\stackoverflow\">questions and
answers</a> that I have posted on StackOverFlow! I don't update this regularly
now as most of my code is either in an internal repository or uploaded on
github. I'm currently in the process of porting all my internal code to a new
project that I'm excited to work on.</p>
