## The Challenge
The challenge is to implement a machine learning model to predict for a given
taxi trip, if a tip will be paid and for a trip with a tip, what is the expected
tip amount. The data that we will be using is the [2017 Green Taxi Trip
Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Green-Taxi-Trip-Data/5gj9-2kzx)
dataset. 

## Understanding the Data
As with all problems related to data, we first have to understand the data. I
don't have to use deep learning, but I would first like to try a classic fully
connected neural network for this problem and see how it performs. Other methods
are possible too. The first thing that I think of would be normalizing the
features. Continuous variables have to be normalized, and categorical variables
have to be one hot encoded. TensorFlow has a really good guide on [feature
columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns). I will be using
TensorFlow for the entire process.

1. `VendorID`
- A code indicating the LPEP provider that provided the record.
- Categorical variable (2 classes, Creative or VeriFone)
- It's probably worth finding out more information about the signifiance of
  this variable.
- I'm guessing that this does not have that much significance - could be worth
  pruning.

2. `lpep_pickup_datetime`
- The date and time when the meter was engaged.
- Multiple categorical variables? Day and Night could be a set of categorical
  variables. Peak hours, lunch hours, clubbing hours could be a set of
  categorical variables.
- Definitely not a continuous variable as 0 is mapped to 0000H, but it doesn't
  make sense to map 0.9999 to 2359H as it is technically really close to 0000H. 

3. `lpep_dropoff_datetime`
- The date and time when the meter was disengaged.
- Same as `lpep_pickup_datetime`.

4. `store_and_fwd_flag`
- This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before
  sending to the vendor, aka “store and forward,” because the vehicle did not
  have a connection to the server
- Categorical variable (2 classes, Yes or No)
- It's probably worth finding out more information about the signifiance of
  this variable.
- I'm guessing that this does not have that much significance - could be worth
  pruning.

5. `RatecodeID`
- The final rate code in effect at the end of the trip.
- Categorical variable (6 classes, Standard rate, JFK, Newark, Nassau or
  Westchester, Negotiated fare, Group ride).

6. `PULocationID`
- This is an interesting one. The attached PDF shows that there is a
  `pickup_longtitude` and `pickup_latitude` field, but looking at the data,
  there clearly isn't a longtitude or latitude. They seem to have converted it
  into zones. That's great, as we don't have to do our own preprocessing to
  convert the latitudes and longtitudes into zones. There probably is a mapping
  dataset out there to account for the slight tilt of Manhattan, which can map
  the latlongs into proper grids.
- Categorical variable (? classes)
- A quick look at the data shows values of 42 and 255. It could potentially
  range from 0 - 255. It's important to note this as we could potentially have a
  very large input vector. Perhaps the [TF Hashed
  Column](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns#hashed_column)
  function?
- Here, we can clearly see that there are more pickups in some area than others.

    </div>

7. `DOLocationID`
- Same as `PULocationID`
- Interestingly, 40 - 50 is a zone where both pickup and dropoff is high. I
  suspect this is the business area...?
- Turns out it isn't! A quick search on Google shows exactly what's going.  New
  York is zoned accordingly and you can see Manhattan
  [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/images/features/taxi_zone_map_manhattan.jpg).
  Why do these taxis pick up and drop so many people at Zone 40 - 50?
- The highest PU and DO happens at 74. Not sure what goes on in Zone 74 but
  that's East Harlem. Probably worth checking that out.
- At this point in time, I decided to read more about why this is the case, and
  found out that the Green Taxi actually means [Boro
  Taxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boro_taxi). They can only pick people up
  from East 96th and West 110th and above! Everything else below is for "Yellow
  Taxis". Also, these cars can drop passengers off anywhere, but can't pick
  people from the yellow zones. A quick look at the histogram shows that some of
  these drivers actually did pick people from yellow zones. I mean if you drive
  someone from East 96th and West 110th to FiDi, you will probably want to pick
  someone to go back up north isn't it? This also means that almost all pick-ups
  in yellow zones won't be tracked. The Green Taxi drivers would probably
  negotiate a fare and not run the meter. This is really really interesting.

8. `passenger_count`
- The number of passengers in the vehicle. This is a driver-entered value.
- Technically discrete but will model as continuous variable.
- Potentially ignore? Driver-entered values may not be that accurate.

9. `trip_distance`
- The elapsed trip distance in miles reported by the taximeter.
- Continuous variable.

10. `fare_amount`
- The time-and-distance fare calculated by the meter.
- Continuous variable.

11. `extra`
- Miscellaneous extras and surchages. Currently, this only includes the $0.50
  and $1 rush hour and overnight charges.
- Continuous variable.
- Given that there is a rush hour charge and overnight charge, perhaps we don't
  have to discretize pickup and dropoff time as it's implicitly factored into
  this. 
- It includes this currently - does the new data have more values? Given that
  the data sheet is outdated.
- Yup - it clearly does have some strange values that we have to clean up, or
  ignore as noise.

    </div>

12. `mta_tax`
- $0.50 MTA tax that is automatically triggered based on the metered rate in
  use.
- It's not true that it's strictly $0.50. It's surprising that there are values
  like $0.81, $0.60, and -$0.50. The negative one surprises me the most.

    </div>

13. `tip_amount`
- This field is automatically populated for credit card tips. Cash tips are not
  included.
- Continuous variable.
- Does this mean that all cash transactions have a 0 `tip_amount`? Need to check
  this.

14. `ehail_fee`
- Not in the data sheet.
- A quick histogram shows that all of them are null too. Simply remove this.

15. `improvement_surchage`
- $0.30 improvement surchage assessed on hailed trips at the flag drop. This is
  a confusing term, so I did some [research](
  https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/nyregion/city-approves-30-surcharge-to-pay-for-accessible-taxis.html)
  on it.
- A histogram shows that over 10M points are $0.30, 220K are $0.00, and 25K are
  -$0.30.
- The negative one stands out the most. Does that mean it's deducted from their
  fare?
- It seems like this probably won't have an impact on tipping, so we could
  probably prune this.

16. `total_amount`
- The total amount charged to passengers. Does not include cash tips.
- What does this mean? Should probably check how this sum was computed.
- Continuous variable.

17. `payment_type`
- A numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip.
- Categorical variable (6 classes, Credit card, Cash, No charge, Dispute,
  Unknown, Voided trip).
- The histogram analysis doesn't show "Voided trip". Looks like it's only 5
  classes.

18. `trip_type`
- A code indicating whether the trip was a street-hail or a dispatch that is
  automatically assigned based on the metered rate in use but can be altered by
  the driver.
- Categorical variable (2 classes, Street-hail, Dispatch). 
- Since it can be altered by the driver, I assume one has a higher metered rate
  than the other. Changing this could probably cause a dispute and thus no tip.
  Might be an important variable.

## Synthesized Understanding of Data
1. It is important to understand exactly how the Green Taxi functions. That
   would guide certain decisions into choosing the right features to use.
2. Some of the variables have dirty values and have to be cleaned. It might be
   worth ignoring them for now and letting the neural network handle the noise.
   We can then clean it and show an improvement.
3. Additional verification on certain variables is necessary as well.
   `total_amount` and `tip_amount` is one such example. 
4. It is important to go through every variable and understand what it is. The
   discrepancy in the data sheet also shows that we can't always trust what is
   given to us. More probing is needed on the side.
5. For `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime`, it's going to be hard
   to model them as they are and the peak hours seem to be factored in in
   `extra` already. We might want to construct a derived feature of duration of
   journey. If the journey is long and time taken is short, a tip might be
   given. Conversely, if the journey is short and time taken is long, there
   might be a traffic jam and a tip isn't given. This might even predict most of
   the tips!
