I try and do as many coding problems as possible as I believe this will hone my
technical skills. Therefore, I solve Project Euler questions in my free time. It
is very tempting to finish as many Project Euler questions as possible and then
wear it as a badge of honour. I must say I have fallen into that trap. In
retrospect, it is a very bad idea. I am reminded of the book, [Art and Fear](
{% post_url 2017-01-01-2017-books %}), which I read in 2017. The quote goes:

I sort of understand this better now. What I should really be pursuing is a
better understanding of problems, not just solving them. For example, I recently
solved Project Euler 81, 82, 83. They were all dynamic programming problems as I
wanted to practice that. In the past, I would just hack out some code and get
the correct answer. Now, I think about the various approaches to solving it.
Should I use a top down or bottom up DP? What about the space saving trick?
What's the complexity of each method? Is there enough space on the recursion
stack? What if we need to output the path as well? If one thinks thoroughly
about all possible variants of the problem, then that's true mastery. It's not
about facing as many DP problems as possible and then achieving mastery. It's
about thinking deeply into a few canonical DP problems. 

This also brings me to a
[post](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-programming-interview-questions-youve-ever-asked-or-been-asked)
that I read about recently. The answer by Leo Polovets was very good. It's a
simple question, but it really tests the candidate.

Remember: Quality, not quantity.
