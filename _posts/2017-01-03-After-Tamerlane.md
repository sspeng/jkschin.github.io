I normally write brief reviews about the books I read. This book is different. It's about history. The first few pages had so many striking statements that I feel compelled to record them down. I normally stick a post-it at an important section, and for this book, I felt that I was sticking a post-it on every paragraph.

### Chapter 1 - Orientations
Truth be told, I have always been in awe at the "perceived-to-be-advanced" societies of Europe and North America. I say this with inverted commas because the first 15 pages of this book has made me rethink this entirely. I will let the quotes speak for themselves (short of just copy pasting the entire book here).

- Far from bringing progress to stationary parts of the world, European interference had blocked the social and cultural advances there were already in train. (Darwin, 2007, p. 11)
- And, far from exerting a confident mastery, Europeans (in this new perspective) were often outwitted, exploited, or simply ignored by locals busy with their own affairs. (Darwin, 2007, p. 11)
- ... young Dutch historian J. C. van Leur (1908 - 42) had denounced the writing of Indonesian history through European eyes - 'from the deck of the ship, the ramparts of the fortress, the high gallery of the trading house', as if nothing could happen without a European being present or at his instigation. Darwin, 2007, p. 11)
- ... Palestinian-American Edward Said denounced the classics of European writing on the history, ethnography and culture of Asia (and by extension elsewhere) as 'orientalist' fantasy. According to Said, European description was fatally flawed by the crude attribution of stereotyped qualities, almost always demeaning, and the persistent attempt to portray Asian societies as the slothful, corrupt or degenerate antitheses of an energetic, masterful, and progressive Europe. (Darwin, 2007, p. 13)
- **European definitions of 'progress', like European observations on the rest of the world, have lost their once unchallenged authority.** (Darwin, 2007, p. 14)
- **This was shocking to me.** Caste in India symbolized Indian backwardness. Yet British rulers, for their own convenience, struck a bargain with Brahmins to harden the caste status into an administrative system (formalized in the census). In colonial Africa a parallel process took place as clans and folowings were reinvented as 'tribes', with chiefly rulers as their ancestral leaders. ... **But in 'decolonized history', the expansion of Europe appears as a vast conspiracy to reorder the non-Western world along pseudo-traditional lines, the better to hold it in check and exploit its resources - indefinitely.** (Darwin, 2007, p.15)

Within 4 pages, one can get the idea of how the history we have been reading is simply 'colonized history'. It's time to read some 'decolonized history'. Take a look around us, "Western Supremacy" is still prevalent. Now don't get me wrong, this is by no means expressing any form of hate towards the West but rather, why are there double standards in society? I have some examples:

- The most recent movie "The Great Wall". I personally haven't watched it but I think I should and perhaps do a film review on the stereotypes. From what I have heard, it's the standard "White Male Hero" once again. Weird isn't it? This is a setting in Asia. But I guess it's Hollywood, that's why.
- In Singapore, expatriates are referred to as executives who wear nice suits and work in the Central Business District (generalization but you get what I mean). Workers from India and China who help build our buildings (really appreciative of them), are called foreign workers. Coders from overseas are called foreign talent. If we actually checked the dictionary of what expatriates mean, it is clear that something is wrong.

I could really go on with the examples (speaking with an accent being one), but this would become far too verbose. It's only the first chapter and I am writing so much. I can't wait to find out about the history of other societies in the following chapters.
