I decided to create this post because I thought it would be extremely inconvenient to create a new post whenever I finish a few problems. I think I will just lump everything into a gigantic post for 1 to 100, since they are relatively trivial problems. The headers are arranged in numerical order.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=12">Problem 12</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** Nothing too fanciful. 7.3 seconds run time. Extremely sub optimal but I just wanted to get the answer. The trick to this question is basically to not brute force. That would take you more than a minute for sure.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=18">Problem 18</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** As the question suggests, you can't brute force it. Or rather, you can, but Problem 67 will not allow you to. An approach to consider would be: How can I reduce the problem? For example, try the case of a triangle with 4 rows. Using the answer from 4 rows, how can I get the answer for 5 rows?

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=67">Problem 67</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** Identical to problem 18. Only difference is that it has a lot more rows. Therefore, you definitely can't brute force this.
