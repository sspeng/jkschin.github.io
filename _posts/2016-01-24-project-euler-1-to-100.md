I decided to create this post because I thought it would be extremely inconvenient to create a new post whenever I finish a few problems. I think I will just lump everything into a gigantic post for 1 to 100, since they are relatively trivial problems. The headers are arranged in numerical order.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=12">Problem 12</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** Nothing too fanciful. 7.3 seconds run time. Extremely sub optimal but I just wanted to get the answer. The trick to this question is basically to not brute force. That would take you more than a minute for sure.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=18">Problem 18</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** As the question suggests, you can't brute force it. Or rather, you can, but Problem 67 will not allow you to. An approach to consider would be: How can I reduce the problem? For example, try the case of a triangle with 4 rows. Using the answer from 4 rows, how can I get the answer for 5 rows?

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=19">Problem 19</a>
**Solved on 25th January 2016.** I don't know if you call this cheating, but I used a Python library. Use Python whenever possible, and C for super speed!

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=20">Problem 20</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** A simple Python script.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=21">Problem 21</a>
**Solved on 25th January 2016.** Wasn't that hard. A simple python script. But I tried to write everything in a single line. I could for some parts, but I decided to use a Try Except clause, and that can't be golfed. Other than that, it would have made a single line.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=22">Problem 22</a>
**Solved on 25th January 2016.** I thought the part on trying to find a mapping from 1=a, 2=b, etc was interesting. I mean you could write code to generate a dictionary, but I found out from stackoverflow that you can use ord() to do something smart!

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=23">Problem 23</a>
**Solved on 25th January 2016.** I wrote a Python script that ran in 38 seconds. Still under the minute requirement! I think C would be instantaneous though. This problem was quite confusing initially. It took me some time to understand what it was asking.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=24">Problem 24</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** Pen and paper will do the trick! Counting from 0th number might be a good idea ;)

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=25">Problem 25</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** A simple Python script.

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=26">Problem 26</a>
**Solved on 25th January 2016.** Haha this was funny. I saw something similar before. In fact, it is <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=358">Problem 358</a>! Took me a few seconds to solve it. 

###<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=67">Problem 67</a>
**Solved on 24th January 2016.** Identical to problem 18. Only difference is that it has a lot more rows. Therefore, you definitely can't brute force this.
