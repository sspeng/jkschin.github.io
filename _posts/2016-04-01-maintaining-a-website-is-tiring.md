Next post after a 1 month hiatus of updating this blog. I have been updating it regularly with Project Euler though. I find that fun and easy to maintain. Just solve a question and talk a little bit about it!

Yup so this title says it all. I find it tiring to update this website. I think it's because I just want to keep generating code non-stop. Every time I'm not coding, I find that I'm slacking off. Yet on the other hand, some down time to write and consolidate my thoughts is important. I think I mentioned this in one of my earlier posts. I should really make it a habit to post often. The design process is very important. Writing allows one to have some form of reflection.

In any case, let's talk about some of the stuff I have done in the past few weeks. I work on Deep Learning now. It's really hard to visualize the images and labels. They usually come in a text file and one has to scroll through the name of the image, and the respective label. That's quite tedious. I was extremely tired of that. I have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS, thus I came up with a small HTML package to visualize this. I called it <a href="https://github.com/jkschin/VIAL">VIAL</a>a>! Go take a look.

I've also started to see the value of good software engineering. I write lots of code now and they are really fragmented. I'm not kidding, it is everywhere! The next thing I should do is to learn how to make a pip package. That way, I can install some very general modules that I write and use it from any directory. Currently, most of my stuff is hard-coded as I would like to get a working prototype quickly. I guess sometimes fast is slow and slow is fast.

I would also like to revisit a point I made in the past about web development. That is an entire field on its own and becoming good at it requires one to keep doing it. I've been trying to get some start-up ideas off the ground, but many web developers in Singapore are risk-averse. They rather take the cash and deliver a web application, than to take a small salary with equity and do a start-up. I do not entirely blame them though. They must have been jaded by the many ideas that people have pitched to them. This isn't ideal for me though. As a programmer myself, we sometimes to take shortcuts or not code elegantly. If this particular developer is someone like that, then the code I receive would be extremely unreadable and hard to maintain and improve on. This will cause a lot of problems down the line. Hence, I definitely need a web developer on the start-up team, if my start-up is based on a web-application. Alternatively, I may have to bite the bullet and jump into web development for a year or two to build the web application.

Keeping my options open!
