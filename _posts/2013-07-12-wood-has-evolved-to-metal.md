A significant portion of our parts were waterjetted from sheet aluminium today! I’ve never used a waterjet before so that was utterly awesome.

I guess the important thing is to note that the waterjetter isn’t reliable, and to always be ready to make spares etc. The band saw actually comes in incredibly useful for fixing such errors.

Regardless, we finally popped everything out of our sheet:

And finally started assembling metal onto metal:
