title: My First Post
---
19th December 2015. I finally started my website that I wanted to start all along. I've been having this idea for the past three years. It took me three whole years to actually getting down to doing it. I faced many issues along the way, and I am going to talk about it next.

I always wanted my website to be The Most Perfect Website. I wanted cool graphics, cool fade in fade out stuff, cool everything. I wanted to code it from scratch with Ruby on Rails. I did not want to use WordPress. And many other reasons. And so, I jumped into Ruby on Rails as it was all the hype for web development.

After doing some tutorials, I found out that it was actually really easy to just install a CMS gem, and I'm done! But I didn't want that. I literally wanted to create it from scratch. As such, I did many tutorials and was overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I had to do to create what I envisioned. It was really hard.

I asked myself: "Why do I want to code a website?" And then I realised that it was because of my belief that people in CS-related fields should know how to maintain their own website. That is indeed true, but most of their sites are just simple pages solely for displaying content. There's nothing fanciful about it because it is unnecessary. And with that, I decided to just host my site on GitHub with the Jekyll gem. 

Jekyll is really pretty cool because it's as hardcore CS as you can get. I'm actually blogging in black and white from Sublime Text. Every blog post made is as simple as a push command to GitHub. My site is really the bare minimal now, and I will add more functionality and styles to it as time goes by. The important thing, is that I got started :)

P.S. I think being a Ruby on Rails expert is still really cool, but time is limited and I choose to focus on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Who knows, I may need to be the main developer for an app one day?
