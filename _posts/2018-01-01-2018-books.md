### Elon Musk - Ashlee Vance
16th February 2018. Elon Musk has the potential of being on the same level as
Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Some might argue that Musk is a successful
industrialist and should be compared to Carnegie and Ford. I disagree. Musk is
pursuing a vision far greater than anyone has thought of: Humans as an
interplanetary species. And he might actually be on track to succeeding, with
the super impressive Falcon Heavy launch and successful landing of the rockets.
Musk is pretty inspiring. He has both positive and negative attributes and I
could definitely learn from his positive attributes. Some notable quotes from
the book:

1. The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click
   ads (p. 12).
2. Read Huebner's paper on "A Possible Declining Trend in Worldwide Innovation"
   (p. 13).
3. Zip2 was Musk's first start-up and it was advertising related. People told
   his salesman that "advertising on the Internet sounded like the dumbest thing
   they had ever heard of" (p. 64). Look where we are for that now. We shouldn't
   always listen to everyone!
4. Okay, what are the things that affect how a team functions. The first obvious
   assumption would be that other people will behave like you. But that's not
   true. Even if they would like to behave like you, they don't necessarily have
   all the assumptions or information that you have in your mind. So, if I know
   a certain set of things, and I talk to a replica of myself but only
   communicate half the information, you can't expect that the replica would
   come to the same conclusion. You have to put yourself in a position where you
   say, 'Well, how would this sound to them, knowing what they know?' (p. 73).
5. They might take their chances entering a credit card number but exposing just
   their bank accounts to the Web was out of the question to many (p. 77). Look
   where we are with online banking now.
6. The whole idea was to shift away from slow-moving banks with their mainframes
   taking days to process payments and to create a kind of agile bank account
   where you could move money around with a couple of clicks on a mouse or an
   e-mail (p. 84).
7. The PayPal episode was a mixed bag for Musk ... The book painted Musk as an
   egomaniacal, stubborn jerk, making wrong decisions at every turn, and
   portrayed Thiel and Levchin as heroic geniuses (p. 89). I always thought
   PayPal was led by Thiel, turns out that was true but I didn't get the full
   story.
8. He could have spent ten million dollars to send up the mice, but instead
   he'll spend hundreds of millions and probably fail like all the others that
   proceeded him (p. 109). Look where Musk is now.
9. Tom Mueller was the driving force behind SpaceX (p. 109).
10. I told him that yeah, I'd worked on a 650,000-pound thrust engine at TRW and
    knew every part of it. Mueller set the engine down and tried to keep up with
    Musk's interrogation. "How much would that big engine cost?" Musk asked.
    Mueller told him TRW built it for about $12 million. Musk shot back, "Yeah,
    but how much could you really do it for?" (p. 111) This has got to be one of
    the best questions in the entire book.
11. Kestrel started out as a rael dog, and one of my proudest moments was taking
    it from terrible to great performance with stuff we bought online and did in
    the machine shop. Some members of the Texas crew honed their skills to the
    point that they could build a test-worthy engine in three days. These same
    people were required to be adept at software (p. 125).
12. What Musk would not tolerate were excuses or the lack of a clear plan of
    attack (p. 126). 
13. When you interview make sure you can talk concretely about what you do
    rather than use buzzwords (p. 130).
14. The engineering corps flew into a collective rage every time they caught
    Musk in the press claiming to have designed the Falcon rocket more or less
    by himself (p. 133).
15. The entire part on Kwajalein Island was amazing (p. 135). 
16. The engineers were constantly baffled by what Musk would fund and what he
    wouldn't. Back at headquarters, someone would ask to buy a $200,000 machine
    or a pricey part that they deemed essential to Falcon 1's success, and Musk
    would deny the request. And yet he was totally comfortable paying a similar
    amount to put a shiny surface on the factory floor to make it look nice. On
    Omelek, the workers wanted to pave a two-hundred-yard pathway between the
    hangar and the launchpad to make it easier to transport the rocket. Musk
    refused (p. 137). I'm baffled by this too but there was a section where it
    was said that Musk does everything based on the daily burn rate.
17. The dash to the United States and back showed that SpaceX's thirty-person
    team had real pluck in the face of adversity and inspired everyone on the
    island. A traditional three-hundred-person-strong aerospace launch crew
    would never have tried to fix a rocket like that on the fly (p. 139).
18. Had anyone from Detroit stopped by Tesla Motors at this point, they would
    have ended up in hysterics. The sum total of the company's automotive
    expertise was that a couple of the guys at Tesla really liked cars and
    another one had created a series of science fair projects based on
    technology that the automotive industry considered ridiculous. What's more,
    the founding team had no intention of turning to Detroit for advice on how
    to build a car company. No, Tesla would do what every other Silicon Valley
    start-up had done before it, which was hire a bunch of young, hungry
    engineers and figure things out as they went along (p. 155). 
19. An undergraduate, Berdichevsky volunteered to quit school, work for free,
    and sweep the floors at Tesla if that's what it took to get a job. The
    founders were impressed with his spirit and hired Berdichevsky after one
    meeting (p. 156).
20. Tesla formed a six-person task force to deal with the battery issue (p.
    159). The entire part on the exploding batteries was interesting.
21. Eberhard was apparently the founder of Tesla (p. 171). 
22. If you told him that you made a particular choice because 'it was the
    standard way things had always been done,' he'd kick you out of a meeting
    fast. He'd say, 'I never want to hear that phrase again ... ' (p. 177).
23. The total market for satellites, related services, and the rocket launches
    needed to carry them to space has exploded over the past decade from about
    $60 billion per year to more than $200 billion (p. 216).
24. He rebuffed requests to buy specialized tooling equipment, until the
    engineers could explain in clear terms why they needed certain things and
    until experience taught him better (p. 229).
25. Musk would grill people and ask a lot of questions because he was trying to
    learn (p. 230).
26. The story of Steve Davis (p. 234).
27. Acronyms (p. 239).
28. Elon felt like it was the most important problem facing Tesla at the time
    and that's always what he deals with and how he prioritizes (p. 309).

Elon is successful because of his character. With his first success, he built on
it and there were compounding effects, which is what we see today. Only time
will tell if his companies will be successful, but I believe it will. He has
formed something of a cult following and that definitely feeds his ego and
drives him to work even harder. He's even compared to Tony Stark, which is
probably the best compliment of the 21st Century.

### The Looming Tower - Lawrence Wright 
4th February 2018. First book of the year! This book is about the events leading
up to 9/11. The events had a common theme; the main reasons as to why it
happened was because of politics, religion and economics. The more history I
read, the more I realize that the world will never be in a constant state. The
great Egyptian and Roman empires fell. It is naive to think that the current
state of the world would be the same in a 100 years. What then, is the fabric
that holds the country/world together? 

It's a simple question but it's hard to answer. We have monarchies, democracies,
dictatorships, etc. We have different religions. We have people of different
colour. The single thing that holds us together is language. With language, we
can have dialogue. With dialogue, we can build a common understanding. With the
common understanding, we can then agree to disagree on various issues and
further the entity's interests. Tribes of cavemen in the past probably used sign
language to communicate with other tribes. Countries today hold high level
meetings to communicate with other countries. In summary, language, is the
fabric that holds the world together. 

This is an established fact for all of known human history (if you don't
nitpick, but feel free to email me for a debate on this). While this is true,
I'd like to challenge it. I don't believe the future will be held together by
language. I believe the future will be held together by ideals that are related
to the advancement of Man.

So what has all this got to do with the book? Well, once again, this statment is
an oversimplification, but if the entire world works with the vision of
"advancing Man", then perhaps we would achieve world peace and great
technological leaps.

### Shoe Dog - Phil Knight
23rd July 2018. I've taken a long break from reading. Spent most of my spare
time working and reading technical books. Finally got down to reading this book
which was on my reading list for awhile. It's amazing how Phil ran his company
on debt in the early stages. Promising things that didn't exist yet. That's
perhaps how business works. It's also very admirable how he abided by his
principles of staying truthful - that won him many court cases. Breaking the
rules and hiding stuff from Nissho and then getting away with it because he was
driven by ambition was a great story. The Japanese were also very understanding.
Once again, these successful people are not driven by money - they are driven by
passion.  Phil had a fundamental belief in shoes. What's my fundamental belief?

On another note, I would love a library in my house in future. Just like the one
Johnson had. Some quotes:

1. I believe in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles
   every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were
   better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for
   themselves. Belief, I decided. Belief is irresistible (p. 56).
2. But business has its warlike parallels. Someone somewhere once said that
   business is war without bullets, and I tended to agree (p. 90).
3. Page 179 is the point where Phil started to manufacture Nike shoes.
4. Ours was a difficult, death-drenched age, and at least one every day you were
   forced to ask yourself: What's the point? (p. 213).
5. Supply and demand is always the root problem in business. It's been true
   since Phoenician traders raced to bring Rome the coveted purple dye that
   colored the clothing of royals and rich people; there was never enough purple
   to go around (p. 233).
6. Fear of failure, I thought, will never be our downfall as a company. Not that
   any of us thought we wouldn't fail; in fact we had every expectation that we
   would. But when we did fail, we had faith that we'd do it fast, learn from
   it, and be better for it (p. 254).
7. I would search my mind and heart and the only thing I could come up with was
   this world - "winning." (p. 281)
8. We were disrupting the nation's entire economic system, he said. It's simply
   not right, he insisted, or feasible, that a shoe worker makes more than a
   medical doctor (p. 374). This point really resonated with me. I've always
   wondered why poverty can't be solved by raising wages of everyone. These
   things take time.
9. And yet I know that this regret clashes with my secret regret - that I can't
   do it all over again (p. 381).
