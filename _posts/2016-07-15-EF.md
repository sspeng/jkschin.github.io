I got the interview for EF on a Thursday in early June 2016. I was happy and excited for it. One part of the interview struck me though: A Technical Interview - demo something that you've built.

I was in a fix. I can't demonstrate my work in my day job. I had to come up with something that is impressive within a short amount of time. My interview was next Wednesday. 

Time is short. I had to build on my strengths and solve an interesting problem. What are my strengths? Well, I have been working on mostly Computer Vision and Deep Learning in the past few months. I would say I am above average in this area (I can't compare to the Masters and PhD students for sure). I shall solve a problem that can be solved with CV and DL. What problem shall I solve? Well, anything that makes the world more efficient.

An idea came to my mind. I have always thought about making self checkout counters at supermarkets more efficient. Barcodes were invented quite long ago. Why are we still using it? Why do we need a cashier to scan every single item? Can we simply have a conveyor belt, where customers put their items on the belt in a certain orientation, and let it pass through a black box, similar to what we have at airports? I decided to work on this.

I spent 8 hours on Saturday, 8 hours on Sunday, 2 hours on Monday, and 2 hours on Tuesday, and built a little demonstrator within 20 work hours.
