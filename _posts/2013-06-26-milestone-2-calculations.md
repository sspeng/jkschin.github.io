I did up a neat excel sheet which allowed me to calculate some simple approximated values from a few given parameters:

Since the power output of the motor is roughly equal to the approximated power loss due to air drag of the kart at 35kmh, and given that the motor would definitely not perform at 100%, I can say that our kart will not even remotely hit 35kmh. I might be wrong though.

I actually secretly hope it does go above 35 =/
