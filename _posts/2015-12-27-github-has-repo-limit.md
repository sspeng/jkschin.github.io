Very pleased with my progress thus far. I am already at Version 1.3 of my website and it's looking real good! I really like the lists thing. It makes stuff really neat and has a small thumbnail that makes it even more appealing. It's generally pretty good now, but doesn't scale as well on a mobile as I have set the image size to be specifically 150px by 150px. I will have to change that to be percentage based in future. This requires some javascript though. Shall get down to it soon.

I have just populated my blog with the posts from my Electric Vehicle (EV) project back at MIT with Andrew Toh, my project mate. Most of the stuff is actually pulled from <a href="http://atohyk.wordpress.com">his blog</a> as we were sharing it at that time. I thought it would be good to have an independent one myself. So I manually pulled it over. It's pretty neat now in jekyll, so I won't have to worry about changing platforms in future (I hope).

So yes, I was pushing my local repository to the remote one on GitHub and it took a really long time. It suddenly occurred to me that perhaps there will be a size limit to a repository. True enough, it's 1GB and I will receive a "kind reminder" when I exceed 1GB. Looks like all projects that have lots of pictures have to be in another repository. In any case, it ain't too bad now. Less than 200MB.
