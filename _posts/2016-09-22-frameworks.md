It's almost a month since the previous TGEF. Time passed really fast. It didn't feel like it at all! 

Over the past 2 months, I've been really focused on customer development. I've found out a lot about the space of video analytics and natural language processing. When I say a lot, I don't mean I've found out everything. There's still a lot more to find out but I think I have a rough picture now. 

I have talked to a lot of people and each time, I compile reports to consolidate my thoughts. I now have 7 reports worth of information, coming up to about almost 50 pages. I try and write them extremely concisely. Try as I might, they are coherent intra-report, but not coherent inter-report. As such, I might actually miss out some information that I would have liked to find out but didn't. Or something I should have talked about but didn't. Hence the title of this post. There is a need to come up with a framework to scientifically analyse a potential idea. Or perhaps even a framework to guide conversations. I was combing through my reports and I see some overlapping themes. Here's a framework that I will continue developing over time.

1. What's the problem? 

	- This part is kind of open ended as all problems are different. It's about describing the problem thoroughly in this section. Each problem will be a different bullet point. Do note that for each bullet point, something in the "Technical Aspect" portion needs to solve it. 

2. Business Aspect

	- Scalability?

		- Which countries?
		- Potential cultural issues in the country that prevent you from entering the market?

	- Market?

		- Market size?
		- Time to capture entire market?
		- Market size captured per annum?
		- Cost saving or value adding? If cost saving, how much cost? If value adding, how much value?

	- Competitors?



3. Technical Aspect  

	- As mentioned above, the points here need to solve the problems mentioned above. If not, mention which problem you are focused on solving.
	- Applied research or innovation?
	- Can it be easily copied?

4. Operations Aspect

	- If I work on this, will it be easy to hire top talent?
