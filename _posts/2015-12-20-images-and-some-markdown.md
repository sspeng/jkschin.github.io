Woohoo. Second post. Making some good progress. I really should contribute a little everyday. It makes things so much easier.

I took screenshots of my website at it's very bare stage. I can look back on it in future and see how far I've come!

I've also figured out how to highlight code fragments like in Sublime Text:
{% highlight python %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
I believe this is going to be very useful in future. It seems kinda hackerish that I have to colour the "pre" tags background black.

I've also added some bootstrap to the website, so it doesn't span the entire browser.

Something that still irritates me a lot is the fact that when I click About, About does not become active. I will have to fix that. Since this post was mostly about the changes I made to the website, I have decided to add a version page in the footer. This way, I can truly track all the changes I've made.
