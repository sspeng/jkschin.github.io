<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=14">Question 14</a>
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=15">Question 15</a>
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=16">Question 16</a>
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=17">Question 17</a>

14 was simple. Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Problem</a> has not been proved yet, I assume that there's no smart way to do this...? In any case, C is really fast. In case this requires some crazy long loop. Coded it in C and got the answer instantly.

15 was simple too. Did it with a calculator. No code required.

16 reminded me that when dealing with large numbers, always use available libraries. Why reinvent the wheel? The important point is to recognize the overflow for this problem.

Once again, I used a library for 17. Removed the hyphens and spaces, and did a simple count!

Relatively simple problems. Until I hit 18 of course. It's getting kind of late, and 18 requires a bit more time I think. I shall solve 12 and 18 over the weekend!
