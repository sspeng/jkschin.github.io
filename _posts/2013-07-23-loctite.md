And so we’ve finally started loctiting our stuff. All our wheels are now liberally blessed with loctite, and soon our entire cart will be loctited. Mwahaha. The brake lever in the photo now works as well. Woohoo.

That said, we’re having a huge problem with the chain tension:

The chain tension in this picture is immense. I don’t know how we gorilla-ed it in, but it’s insane. Probably gotta do something to the motor mount holes to get the tension down.
