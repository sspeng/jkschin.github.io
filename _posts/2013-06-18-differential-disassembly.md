We found a cheap differential and we thought weâ€™d disassemble it, just to learn more about them so we could decide better if we wanted to construct/buy one (the one we could order was almost the exact same thing from Surplus Center).

It was an extremely simple design, but at least we learnt sort of how much material to expect, how a simple bevel differential works etc.
