<h2>Part 1</h2>
In my previous post on SVHN TensorFlow, I mentioned that a rotate function would be good! Turns out that someone else also had the same idea too! The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/781">issue</a> is now on TensorFlow GitHub.

I would like to take this small project on. It will definitely give me a deeper understanding of TensorFlow, and I can make a contribution to make TensorFlow better. It's a small contribution, but that's what open source is about isn't it! Many people making small contributions, to make something really good. I shall post about coding this contribution in this post.
