for my thoughts on the books read in 2018. Looking forward to populating this
page with more books in 2019!

### 21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Yuval Noah Harari
1st February 2019. This was a lot more refreshing than Homo Deus, though there
are overlapping themes with Sapiens and Homo Deus. I really liked Harari's idea
of how "everything" is a construct - for example, countries are a construct. He
ended the book with Meditation, and this coincided with the current trend of
everyone meditating. Calm and Headspace are such examples, and the former
company raised a whopping sum recently and achieved unicorn status. It'd be
exciting to see how humanity develops over the next few years.
