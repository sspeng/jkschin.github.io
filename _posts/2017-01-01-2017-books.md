What a way to start 2017! I sat at home all day and finished my first book of the year. The Four Legendary Kingdoms by Matthew Reilly. I will be updating this post as I read more throughout the year.

### Art & Fear - David Bayles and Ted Orland
22nd January 2017. This book has been on my reading list for a particularly long time. I really liked that story about the ceramics teacher splitting the class into two - half will be graded on quantity, the other on quality. I mentioned this quote in a speech I gave to the Freshmores at SUTD so I won't reproduce it in full. As the title mentioned, it's about art. If you would replace every 'art' with 'company' or 'entrepreneurship', it would start sounding like an entrepreneurship book. Take this quote for example:

- *Your materials are, in fact, one of the few elements of artmaking you can reasonably hope to control. As for everything else - well, conditions are never perfect, sufficient knowledge rarely at hand, key evidence always missing, and support notoriously fickle. All that you do will inevitably be flavored with uncertainty... (pg. 19)*

So true! This is exactly like doing a start-up. It's about getting into a car with some idea of where you want to go, but you don't need to know the entire route (possible road blocks, toilet stops, car workshops, etc.). Just deal with the uncertainty!

Or take this quote for example:

- *Adams was right: to require perfection is to invite paralysis. (pg. 30)*

Very similar to the story on ceramics class. Yes, perfection is something that perhaps one should pursue. But one should never "not do anything" in pursuit of perfection. Just keep making pots!

One quote on becoming more skilled struck me. We all want to become better at something. Therefore, the easiest thing we do is to pursue technical challenges as they have clear goals and measurable feedback. You can write great and efficient code. You can play a really technical piano piece. However:

- *The underlying problem with this is not that the pursuit of technical excellence is wrong, exactly, but simply that making it the primary goal puts the cart before the horse. (pg. 95)*

Fo example when mastering Machine Learning and the Mathematics behind it, we sometimes forget to think creatively and miss out some possible insights! 

Overall, a great book I highly recommend to everyone. Artists, programmers, and entrepreneurs alike.

### Einstein - His Life and Universe - Walter Isaacson
20th February 2017. Finally finished reading Einstein's biography. It was a really tough read I must say. Spent quite a long time trying to finish it. Some parts were really boring and so many characters were involved. 

Key takeaways:
1. Always have the curiosity of a child when faced with a problem.
2. Is nature truly simple? Newton and Einstein seemed to believe fervently in this.
3. Be willing to challenge authority and be nonconformist.

*I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.*

Always remember this.

### The Four Legendary Kingdoms - Matthew Reilly
1st January 2017. A pleasant surprise! Really delighted with this book for many reasons. I never thought it was a sequel to 7AW, 6SS, 5GW. I knew it was Jack West but it never occurred to me. We can expect 3 more books for this series I guess! The moment one of the champions put on his anti-flash glasses, and when they had to partner someone and that person was a large sized woman, it was so striking that Scarecrow would be in this book. Reilly had finally combined the main characters from 2 of his major series. I also liked the parallel drawn with mythology. The part when Jack West faced off Scarecrow was expected, and it was obvious that Scarecrow wouldn't die. I still liked it though.  

This book also introduced a large conspiracy theory of a shadow kingdom that rules the world beneath governments. Given how old this world is, that might be actually be true! But then again, that's just an idea, nothing much to ponder over. An entertaining book and a great start to 2017!

### The Greatest Salesman in the World - Og Mandino
27th January 2017. A really thin book that can be finished in less than 2 hours. I chanced upon this book through Amazon recommendations and cross-referencing it of course. There are '10 Ancient Scrolls' inside this book, each to be read thrice a day over 30 days. The scrolls are about inducing a habit into you, and they do make sense. So I'll definitely be trying this out this year.

### The Hard Thing about Hard Things - Ben Horowitz
27th February 2017. It's quite surprising that I finished this book within a week from finishing Einstein's biography. It's 277 pages. Words are quite big though. Perhaps that's why. I learnt many things from this book. And through reading this book, I exactly see EF's perspective. Having said that, always remember that there are 2 schools of thought. I've booked marked many pages in this book so I'll list the learning points.

1. You have to keep secrets sometimes. When Ben was transiting to Opsware, he had to give no indication to the rest of the staff what his plan was (p. 32).
2. Create artificial deadlines. Ben did this when negotiating the sale of Loudcloud. Create urgency. Host both buying companies on your premises and time it such that they walk by each other (p. 35).
3. Do everything and anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal done (p. 36).
4. Opsware bought Tangram just because the customer loved Tangram. Sometimes acquisitions are done just to please a customer (p. 46).
5. "I have buy-in from my champion, the vice president that he reports to, and the head of purchasing. My champion assures me that the deal will be done by the end of the quarter." Mark Cranney tore him apart by asking if he has spoken to the VP or the VP's peer and said that he "does not have a fucking deal" so call the VP right now (p. 50).
6. It's important to be transparent in your company (p. 66).
7. Do not hire for **lack of weakness**. Hire for **strengths** (p. 74).
8. Humans tend to take action on positive indicators and look for alternative explanations on negative leading indicators (p. 87).
9. In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally (p. 101).
10. Startups should train their people (p. 105).
11. If you would be shocked and horrified if Company X hired several of your employees, then you should not hire any of theirs (p. 117).
12. Giving the team a task that it cannot possibly perform is called crippling the army (p. 131). 
13. Anything you measure automatically creates a set of employee behaviours (p. 133).
14. Management debt (p. 134).
15. Titles and promotions. The Peter Principle and The Law Of Crappy People (p. 159).
16. When you hire someone new (or even some senior executive), demand cultural compliance. It's your company, your culture, and your way of doing business (p. 173).
17. One-on-one meetings (p. 176).
18. Everybody learns to be a CEO by being a CEO. No training can prepare you for it (p. 202).
19. If you don't like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic, don't become CEO (p. 206).
20. When the company gets large, and the founders do not have the courage to decide who is in charge, every employee suffers the inconvenience of double approval (p. 210). 
21. A CEO must be able to articulate the vision, align interests, and have the ability to achieve the vision (p. 222).
22. Shit sandwich (p. 230). Well, just be honest. I don't really do the shit sandwich stuff.
23. As CEO, there is never enough time to gather all information needed to make a decision. You must systematically acquire the knowledge of everything that might impact any decision that you might make (p. 238). Some example questions here.
24. Freaky Friday Management Technique. Swap the heads of 2 quarrelling divisions (p. 252).
25. Is the company for sale? The best answer: If the company achieves product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number one, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will likely be sold (p. 262).
