What a way to start 2017! I sat at home all day and finished my first book of
the year. The Four Legendary Kingdoms by Matthew Reilly. I will be updating this
post as I read more throughout the year.

### Art & Fear - David Bayles and Ted Orland 
22nd January 2017. This book has been on my reading list for a particularly long
time. I really liked that story about the ceramics teacher splitting the class
into two - half will be graded on quantity, the other on quality. I mentioned
this quote in a speech I gave to the Freshmores at SUTD so I won't reproduce it
in full. As the title mentioned, it's about art. If you would replace every
'art' with 'company' or 'entrepreneurship', it would start sounding like an
entrepreneurship book. Take this quote for example:

- *Your materials are, in fact, one of the few elements of artmaking you can
  reasonably hope to control. As for everything else - well, conditions are
  never perfect, sufficient knowledge rarely at hand, key evidence always
  missing, and support notoriously fickle. All that you do will inevitably be
  flavored with uncertainty... (pg. 19)*

So true! This is exactly like doing a start-up. It's about getting into a car
with some idea of where you want to go, but you don't need to know the entire
route (possible road blocks, toilet stops, car workshops, etc.). Just deal with
the uncertainty!

Or take this quote for example:

- *Adams was right: to require perfection is to invite paralysis. (pg. 30)*

Very similar to the story on ceramics class. Yes, perfection is something that
perhaps one should pursue. But one should never "not do anything" in pursuit of
perfection. Just keep making pots!

One quote on becoming more skilled struck me. We all want to become better at
something. Therefore, the easiest thing we do is to pursue technical challenges
as they have clear goals and measurable feedback. You can write great and
efficient code. You can play a really technical piano piece. However:

- *The underlying problem with this is not that the pursuit of technical
  excellence is wrong, exactly, but simply that making it the primary goal puts
  the cart before the horse. (pg. 95)*

Fo example when mastering Machine Learning and the Mathematics behind it, we
sometimes forget to think creatively and miss out some possible insights! 

Overall, a great book I highly recommend to everyone. Artists, programmers, and
entrepreneurs alike.

### Case Interview Secrets - Victor Cheng
2nd April 2017. Decided to read this book because knowing about case interviews
and management consulting is good general knowledge. I've always wondered why
some firms love to give "estimation questions". In management consulting,
clients always ask such questions like "how big is market X?". The ability to
estimate closely and quickly is valuable.  Clients also value the ability to
resolve long-standing debates of *opinions*, using *estimates* based on
reasonable *assumptions* (p.  20).

Estimation Skills:

1. Doing precise arithmetic with large numbers
2. Rounding numbers intelligently.
3. Finding a proxy.
4. Identifying how the proxy is imperfect.
5. Segmenting estimates to minimize proxy imperfections.
6. Solve segmented estimates with assumptions.

Why do such firms use case interviews?

1. Case interviews mirror consultants' on-the-job experience (p. 38).

Mindsets to maintain when in a case interview or even when you're a consultant.

1. When the interviewer asks you a random question in an interview, stop
   thinking like a candidate trying to impress the interviewer. Instead, think
   like a consultant: Ask yourself what you would feel comfortable saying to a
   client, knowing your firm's reputation is on the line - because it is (p.
   38).
2. The consultant's official role in the interview is to decide whether the firm
   should hire you. She is also thinking, *Do I want you on my team right now?
   Will my life get easier if you're on my team?* Phrased differently, the
   interviewer is asking herself, *Will you be an independent problem solver
   fairly quickly, or will I have to babysit you for the next 2 years of your
   career?* (p.  44)
3. Given the client's main objective, what *key* information is needed to answer
   the client's question? Don't boil the ocean. If your client wants a cup of
   hot water, you could scoop a cup out and boil it, or boil the entire ocean
   and then scoop a cup out (p. 45).
4. When thinking of using the word *always*, think twice. It's a superlative
   that is really hard to defend. If you really insist on using a strong word,
   then you can either *get more factual evidence to support your argument,
   which takes time*, or *soften the language of your argument and use the facts
   you already have.* (p. 49)
5. Clients do not accept factually accurate recommendations; they accept
   factually supported recommendations *they can understand* (p. 50). 
6. If your clients don't follow your argument, guess whose fault it is? If
   you're a super-brilliant consultant but you make the senior client feel dumb
   because he couldn't follow your argument, guess what? Someone's getting fired
   from the relationship, and it won't be the client (p. 50). Some clients
   actually don't see the value of paying a firm millions of dollars for a
   consultant to be there, so don't put on airs. 
7. Think and communicate linearly. A -> B, B -> C, therefore A -> C (p. 50).
8. *Process excellence* is important. The ability to follow a structured,
   analytical problem-solving *process*; and the ability to reach the correct
   conclusions based on that process. Of these, the former is more important (p.
   53).
9. The majority of the time spent is *not* spent on solving the client's
   problem. It's spent on isolating the underlying cause of the client's
   problem. Never ever propose a solution to a case until you've isolated and
   defined the problem. Then and only then can you propose a solution (p. 97).

With this in mind, we move on to the core problem solving tools. Hypothesis;
Issue-tree; Drill-down analysis; Synthesis. Synthesis is extremely important
because it conveys the message with clarity and confidence. Here is an example
of how the message can be delivered to the client, and we should all work
towards this: **Client should do X because it will have ripple effects Y and Z,
both of which are favourable. There may be concern about issue A, but the
benefits of ripple effects Y and Z outweigh it.**.

Hypothesis

- In science, the scientific method is an iterative cycle, with each phase based
  on a slightly different hypothesis born of the observations made in the
  previous phase. This iterative process captures the essence of the aspiring
  consultant's ideal problem solving process (p. 58).
  - Interviewer: Company ABC's profit is down 20 percent.
  - Candidate: I'm going to hypothesize (based on some background information)
    that the client's industry is in a price war, which has caused the client's
    sales and profits to decline. To test this hypothesis, I need to know how
    the components of profits have changed since last year. In particular, I
    need to know how sales and expenses have changed since last year.
  - Sales have remained unchanges, and costs have increased by 20%.
  - My conclusion is that my initial hypothesis seems to have been proven false.
    It looks like the client is facing a cost problem more so than a revenue
    problem. My next hypothesis is ...
- **Always state a hypothesis in a case interview. You almost immediately fail
  if you don't.** (p. 70)
  - The next question then is, when?
  - Consider what works with clients. If you meet client team members for the
    first time and tell them your hypothesis as to what is wrong with their
    company *before* you even ask them any questions, they look at you with
    suspicion and distrust. Ask some questions first and then state a
    hypothesis. But don't forget to state one.
  - *The hypothesis is more important than the framework.* (p. 84)

Issue tree

- The only reason you use a framework or issue tree is to test a hypothesis (p.
  75). Hence, always state a hypothesis!
- Validity tests for issue trees:
  - Does the tree make sense given the hypothesis?
  - Are the branches mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive? This point
    is hard at times, but try and fulfil it. Grouping customers according to age
    is good, but hobbies is not that good, as people can have multiple hobbies.
  - Conclusiveness test. If all the branches of the issue tree turn out to be
    true, it is almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which the opposite of
    the hypothesis would be true. Basically, flip a few statements and see if
    you can still make the hypothesis true.
  - When the entire issue tree is drawn out, communicate all branches and talk
    about which branch you will analyse first.

Drill-down analysis

- Start with the branch that eliminates the most uncertainty first. Example: My
  hypothesis is that the client's profitability problem is driven by a revenue
  decline, not a cost increase. I'd like to draw out this issue tree to show
  both sides. I'll start with the revenue side and, if necessary, circle back to
  the cost side (p. 93).
- 70/30 quantitative and qualitative analysis. An appropriately quantitatively
  oriented candidate would hear that same background and seek to *quantitatively
  verify what she has heard qualitatively.* (p. 94)

Synthesis

- Tells the client *what* to do, *what you discovered* and *what it means*.
  Couches your recommendation *in the context* of the overall business, not just
  in terms of the single decision the client asked you to assess.
- State action-oriented recommendation/conclusion. Supporting point 1.
  Supporting point 2. Supporting point 3. Restate recommendation/conclusion (p.
  103).
- Synthesis doesn't only have to be at the end. It can be during drill-down
  analysis. "I can conclude that sales are not causing the profit problem,
  because first, sales have remained unchanges in the past year, and second,
  costs have gone up by $10 million and account for 100% of the problem. I would
  like to analyze costs now to understand better which costs have increased and
  why." (p. 111)

The key to mastering cases is to use these 4 concepts and lots of practice.
Frameworks can help, which is what I will summarize next. The mistake made is to
memorize frameworks. There is an infinite number of cases in the world. One can
never memorize enough. 3 core frameworks, together with the principled approach
of following the 4 concepts, can cover many of the cases one will encounter.

### Einstein - His Life and Universe - Walter Isaacson 
20th February 2017. Finally finished reading Einstein's biography. It was a
really tough read I must say. Spent quite a long time trying to finish it. Some
parts were really boring and so many characters were involved. 

Key takeaways:
1. Always have the curiosity of a child when faced with a problem.
2. Is nature truly simple? Newton and Einstein seemed to believe fervently in
   this.
3. Be willing to challenge authority and be nonconformist.

*I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.*

Always remember this.

### Only The Paranoid Survive - Andrew S. Grove 
12th March 2017. Andrew Grove was the CEO of Intel. He shares his insights on
how he managed the company in this book. Specifically, he talks a lot about
strategic inflection points and how to navigate them. These are points whereby
something huge has moved in the market. Something in the form of a 10X change.
These factors include competitors, complementors, customers, suppliers,
potential competitors, what your business is doing can be done in a different
way.

1. No amount of formal planning can anticipate changes in the market. You need
   to plan the way a fire department plans: It cannot anticipate where the next
   fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is
   capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event
   (p. 6).
2. Given the amorphous nature of an inflection point, how do you know the right
   moment to take appropriate action, to make the changes that will save your
   company or your career? Unfortunately, you don't. But you can't wait until
   you do know: Timing is everything (p. 35).
3. When you're caught in the turbulence of a strategic inflection point, the sad
   fact is that instinct and judgment are all you've got to guide you through
   (p.  35).
4. **To navigate these inflection points, you have to train your instincts to
   pick up a different set of signals. These signals may have been out there all
   along but you may have ignored them. The strategic inflection point is the
   time to wake up and listen (p. 35).** In other words, as the CEO, your job is
   really to gather information and piece a picture together and make critical
   decisions.  Hence, listening is a very important skill.
5. After 1981, when IBM chose Intel to provide the microprocessor in their PC,
   Intel grew to become the most widely accepted supplier of microprocessors.
   After that, industry participants in the layers above found it more
   economically advantageous to build their business on Intel architecture
   microchips than on any other. **If you base your business on the volume
   leader, you will be going after a larger business yourself (p. 46).**
6. In the early eighties, Michael Dell started supplying his friends with
   computers he assembled out of parts in his dorm room at the University of
   Texas (p. 48). He built his business from there.
7. General rules for horizontal industries. First, don't differentiate without a
   difference. **Don't introduce improvements whose only purpose is to give you
   an advantage over your competitor without giving your customer a substantial
   advantage.** Second, in this hypercompetitve horizontal world, opportunity
   knocks when a technology break or other fundamental change comes your way.
   The first mover and only the first mover has a true opportunity. Third, price
   for what the market will bear, price for volume, then work like the devil on
       your costs so that you can make money at that price (p. 51).
8. Jobs resisted PCs because he thought they were a mess. I should read his
   biography on this point (p. 59).
9. In 1931, Charlie Chaplin was still fighting the move to sound movies. Greta
   Garbo was a superstar of silent movies, and she moved to sound movies and
   became a success. The movie industry had a 10X technological change of "sound
   movies", and Greta Garbo navigated this inflection point (p. 61).
10. In 1906, the Food and Drugs Act was passed by Congress. The drug industry
    changed overnight. It revealed that many medicines contain alcohol,
    morphine, cannabis or cocaine (p. 72). Shocking!
11. In strategic inflection points, key personnel get replaced. It's not
    necessarily true that these people were incompetent. It might be more of a
    case that these people have devoted their entire lives to the company and
    therefore has a history of deep involvement in the sequence of events that
    led to the present mess, the new managers come unencumbered by such
    emotional involvement and therefore are capable of applying an impersonal
    logic to the situation. They can see things much more objectively than their
    predecessors did (p. 93).
12. **People in the trenches are usually in touch with impending changes early.
    Salespeople understand shifting customer demands before management does;
    financial analysts are the earliest to know when the fundamentals of a
    business change (p. 97).** Listen to people on the ground!
13. Signal or noise? The Japanese companies were going all in into x-ray
    technology for manufacturing. IBM classified this as signal, and Intel
    classified this as noise. Competent and serious-minded people came to a
    different set of conclusions about a given set of facts. This is not at all
    uncommon. You just have to keep it on your radar (p. 102).
14. Intel had trouble deciding between CISC or RISC. Even though the new RISC
    chip was faster and cheaper, it would have been incompatible with most of
    the software that was available in the marketplace. **Compatibility of a
    product was - and still is - a big factor.** 
    They decided on CISC in the end and when Grove looks back, RISC advantages
    are not that great over CISC (p. 106).
15. Cassandra was the priestess who foretold the fall of Troy. The Cassandras in
your organization are a consistently helpful element in recognizing strategic
inflection points. So who are they? They can come from anywhere in the company,
but they are usually in middle management. Often, they work in **sales**. They
experience the winds of the market. After all, bad sales affect them directly
and thus they take the warnings very seriously (p. 109).
16. You don't have to seek these Cassandras out; if you are in management, they
will find you. Like somebody who sells a product that he is passionate about,
they will "sell" their concern to you with a passion. **Don't argue with them;
even though it's time consuming, do your best to hear them out, and to learn
what they know and to understand why it affects them the way it does (p. 110).**
Classify the time you spend listening to them as an investment in learning
**what goes on at the distant periphery of your business.**
17. During Intel's exit from the memory business, it wasn't as cataclsymic
because finance and production planning people were already moving resources
from memory to microprocessors. When the time came, it was very easy to pull the
plug (p. 111). 
18. Peter Drucker quotes a definition of an entrepreneur as someone who moves
resources from areas of lower productivity and yield to areas of higher
productivity and yield (p. 111). Who's this guy anyway? Should check him out. 
19. In 1984, when Apple introduced the Macintosh, Grove thought it was a
ridiculous toy. Among other weaknesses Grove saw in it, it didn't have a hard
disk and it was excruciatingly slow. The first implementation of the Mac blinded
Grove to the far more important features that came with the graphical interfaces
(p. 112).
20. **You can't judge the significance of strategic inflection points by the
quality of the first version (p. 113).**
21. **It takes many years of consistent conduct to eliminate fear of punishment
as an inhibitor of strategic discussion. It takes only one incident to introduce
it. News of this incident will spread through the organization like wildfire and
shut everyone up (p. 119).**
22. **Management writers use the word "vision". What you're trying to do is
capture the essence of the company and the focus of its business. You are trying
to define what the company will be, yet that can only be done if you also
undertake to define what the company will *not* be (p. 140).**
23. It takes a lot of conviction and trusting your gut to get ahead of your
peers, your staff and your employees while they are still squabbling about which
path to take, and set an unhesitating, unequivocal course whose rightness or
wrongness wil not be known for years. Such a decision really tests the mettle of
the leader (p. 143).
24. Admitting that you need to learn something new is always difficult (p. 145).
Don't be afraid to ask!
25. Should you pursue a highly focused approach, betting everything on one
strategic goal or should you hedge? **Put all of your eggs in one basket and
watch that basket (Mark Twain)(p. 151).**
26. Most companies don't die because they are wrong; most die because they don't
commit themselves. They fritter away their momentum and their valuable resources
while attempting to make a decision. The greatest danger is in standing still
    (p. 152). 
27. Companies that successfully navigate through strategic inflection points
have a good dialectic between bottom-up and top-down actions (p. 159).

An overarching point that Grove talks about is allowing chaos in the company and
then controlling the chaos when the time is necessary. For example, when the
company is comfortable, let the company run and explore many directions, but
when it comes to crunch time, take in the reins. This book is really similar to
"The Hard Thing about Hard Things", which isn't surprising since Horowitz does
cite Grove a lot. I can start to see the convergence of many points. For
example, the CEO needs to have a strong acumen and courage. I guess this is what
they look out for in VCs. 

### The Four Legendary Kingdoms - Matthew Reilly 
1st January 2017. A pleasant surprise! Really delighted with this book for many
reasons. I never thought it was a sequel to 7AW, 6SS, 5GW. I knew it was Jack
West but it never occurred to me. We can expect 3 more books for this series I
guess! The moment one of the champions put on his anti-flash glasses, and when
they had to partner someone and that person was a large sized woman, it was so
striking that Scarecrow would be in this book. Reilly had finally combined the
main characters from 2 of his major series. I also liked the parallel drawn with
mythology. The part when Jack West faced off Scarecrow was expected, and it was
obvious that Scarecrow wouldn't die. I still liked it though.  

This book also introduced a large conspiracy theory of a shadow kingdom that
rules the world beneath governments. Given how old this world is, that might be
actually be true! But then again, that's just an idea, nothing much to ponder
over. An entertaining book and a great start to 2017!

### The Greatest Salesman in the World - Og Mandino
27th January 2017. A really thin book that can be finished in less than 2 hours.
I chanced upon this book through Amazon recommendations and cross-referencing it
of course. There are '10 Ancient Scrolls' inside this book, each to be read
thrice a day over 30 days.  The scrolls are about inducing a habit into you, and
they do make sense. So I'll definitely be trying this out this year.

### The Hard Thing about Hard Things - Ben Horowitz
27th February 2017. It's quite surprising that I finished this book within a
week from finishing Einstein's biography. It's 277 pages. Words are quite big
though. Perhaps that's why. I learnt many things from this book. And through
reading this book, I exactly see EF's perspective. Having said that, always
remember that there are 2 schools of thought. I've booked marked many pages in
this book so I'll list the learning points.

1. You have to keep secrets sometimes. When Ben was transiting to Opsware, he
had to give no indication to the rest of the staff what his plan was (p. 32).
2. Create artificial deadlines. Ben did this when negotiating the sale of
Loudcloud. Create urgency. Host both buying companies on your premises and time
it such that they walk by each other (p. 35).
3. Do everything and anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal
done (p. 36).
4. Opsware bought Tangram just because the customer loved Tangram. Sometimes
acquisitions are done just to please a customer (p. 46).
5. "I have buy-in from my champion, the vice president that he reports to, and
the head of purchasing. My champion assures me that the deal will be done by the
end of the quarter." Mark Cranney tore him apart by asking if he has spoken to
the VP or the VP's peer and said that he "does not have a fucking deal" so call
the VP right now (p. 50).
6. It's important to be transparent in your company (p. 66).
7. Do not hire for **lack of weakness**. Hire for **strengths** (p. 74).
8. Humans tend to take action on positive indicators and look for alternative
explanations on negative leading indicators (p. 87).
9. In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence
that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company
and them personally (p. 101).
10. Startups should train their people (p. 105).
11. If you would be shocked and horrified if Company X hired several of your
employees, then you should not hire any of theirs (p. 117).
12. Giving the team a task that it cannot possibly perform is called crippling
the army (p. 131). 
13. Anything you measure automatically creates a set of employee behaviours (p.
133).
14. Management debt (p. 134).
15. Titles and promotions. The Peter Principle and The Law Of Crappy People (p.
159).
16. When you hire someone new (or even some senior executive), demand cultural
compliance. It's your company, your culture, and your way of doing business (p.
173).
17. One-on-one meetings (p. 176).
18. Everybody learns to be a CEO by being a CEO. No training can prepare you for
it (p. 202).
19. If you don't like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic, don't become
CEO (p. 206).
20. When the company gets large, and the founders do not have the courage to
decide who is in charge, every employee suffers the inconvenience of double
approval (p. 210). 
21. A CEO must be able to articulate the vision, align interests, and have the
ability to achieve the vision (p. 222).
22. Shit sandwich (p. 230). Well, just be honest. I don't really do the shit
sandwich stuff.
23. As CEO, there is never enough time to gather all information needed to make
a decision. You must systematically acquire the knowledge of everything that
might impact any decision that you might make (p. 238). Some example questions
here.
24. Freaky Friday Management Technique. Swap the heads of 2 quarrelling
divisions (p. 252).
25. Is the company for sale? The best answer: If the company achieves
product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be
number one, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will
likely be sold (p. 262).
