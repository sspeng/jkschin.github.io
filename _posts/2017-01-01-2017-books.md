What a way to start 2017! I sat at home all day and finished my first book of the year. The Four Legendary Kingdoms by Matthew Reilly. I will be updating this post as I read more throughout the year.

### Art & Fear - David Bayles and Ted Orland
22nd January 2017. This book has been on my reading list for a particularly long time. I really liked that story about the ceramics teacher splitting the class into two - half will be graded on quantity, the other on quality. I mentioned this quote in a speech I gave to the Freshmores at SUTD so I won't reproduce it in full. As the title mentioned, it's about art. If you would replace every 'art' with 'company' or 'entrepreneurship', it would start sounding like an entrepreneurship book. Take this quote for example:

- *Your materials are, in fact, one of the few elements of artmaking you can reasonably hope to control. As for everything else - well, conditions are never perfect, sufficient knowledge rarely at hand, key evidence always missing, and support notoriously fickle. All that you do will inevitably be flavored with uncertainty... (pg. 19)*

So true! This is exactly like doing a start-up. It's about getting into a car with some idea of where you want to go, but you don't need to know the entire route (possible road blocks, toilet stops, car workshops, etc.). Just deal with the uncertainty!

Or take this quote for example:

- *Adams was right: to require perfection is to invite paralysis. (pg. 30)*

Very similar to the story on ceramics class. Yes, perfection is something that perhaps one should pursue. But one should never "not do anything" in pursuit of perfection. Just keep making pots!

One quote on becoming more skilled struck me. We all want to become better at something. Therefore, the easiest thing we do is to pursue technical challenges as they have clear goals and measurable feedback. You can write great and efficient code. You can play a really technical piano piece. However:

- *The underlying problem with this is not that the pursuit of technical excellence is wrong, exactly, but simply that making it the primary goal puts the cart before the horse. (pg. 95)*

Fo example when mastering Machine Learning and the Mathematics behind it, we sometimes forget to think creatively and miss out some possible insights! 

Overall, a great book I highly recommend to everyone. Artists, programmers, and entrepreneurs alike.

### The Four Legendary Kingdoms - Matthew Reilly
1st January 2017. A pleasant surprise! Really delighted with this book for many reasons. I never thought it was a sequel to 7AW, 6SS, 5GW. I knew it was Jack West but it never occurred to me. We can expect 3 more books for this series I guess! The moment one of the champions put on his anti-flash glasses, and when they had to partner someone and that person was a large sized woman, it was so striking that Scarecrow would be in this book. Reilly had finally combined the main characters from 2 of his major series. I also liked the parallel drawn with mythology. The part when Jack West faced off Scarecrow was expected, and it was obvious that Scarecrow wouldn't die. I still liked it though.  

This book also introduced a large conspiracy theory of a shadow kingdom that rules the world beneath governments. Given how old this world is, that might be actually be true! But then again, that's just an idea, nothing much to ponder over. An entertaining book and a great start to 2017!
