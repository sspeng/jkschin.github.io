What a way to start 2017! I sat at home all day and finished my first book of the year. The Four Legendary Kingdoms by Matthew Reilly. I will be updating this post as I read more throughout the year.

### The Four Legendary Kingdoms - Matthew Reilly
A pleasant surprise! Really delighted with this book for many reasons. I never thought it was a sequel to 7AW, 6SS, 5GW. I knew it was Jack West but it never occurred to me. We can expect 3 more books for this series I guess! The moment one of the champions put on his anti-flash glasses, and when they had to partner someone and that person was a large sized woman, it was so striking that Scarecrow would be in this book. Reilly had finally combined the main characters from 2 of his major series. I also liked the parallel drawn with mythology. The part when Jack West faced off Scarecrow was expected, and it was obvious that Scarecrow wouldn't die. I still liked it though.  

This book also introduced a large conspiracy theory of a shadow kingdom that rules the world beneath governments. Given how old this world is, that might be actually be true! But then again, that's just an idea, nothing much to ponder over. An entertaining book and a great start to 2017!
