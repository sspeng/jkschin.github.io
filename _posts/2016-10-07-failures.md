*Insert Quote by Famous Person*

I guess you get the gist. There are just so many quotes by so many famous people that I can't possibly list them all. It's okay to fail, but you have to learn from it. I document all my failures here as they come.

1. Finding a co-founder in EF.

	Well this isn't really a failure, but it's more of like what to look out for in a co-founder. This question gets asked a lot in EF and honestly there's no good answer to it. I'm really happy with my current co-founder and we get along really well. I think the rule of thumb is to be honest and maintain the team norms (go for lunch together, sit beside each other, check-in with each other, feedback).

2. Untargeted cold emails are not a good idea.

	This will be sort of contradictory with the next point. My co-founder and I basically crawled email addresses from LinkedIn manually (with some help from extensions) and then sent all these people a nicely formatted email. The thing is that we emailed almost everyone in a company and everyone forwarded it to their supervisor. So the supervisor was kinda like "it's not necessary to email everyone". I agree with that, as people won't respond you if you're just spamming everyone. Nonetheless, we had some positive hits.

3. Untargeted cold emails are a good idea.

	We basically sent 50 plus emails to a certain company. One replied. That's awesome. This is justification that it works. But you might annoy people. I'm actually more for the targeted approach.

4. Targeted cold emails are a good idea.
	
	We looked for specific people we wanted to talk to from various companies and industries and sent them emails. We secured 5 meetings with this approach within a week. Pretty decent results actually! 

5. Targeted cold emails are not a good idea.
	
	Well, I guess this process is slow, but you annoy less people. That's about the only downside to do this.
