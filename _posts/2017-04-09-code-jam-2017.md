It's Code Jam season once again! It's fun, and it trains my programming skills
and thinking as well. I started too late this time round. I started at 10pm,
wanting to just qualify. Finished the first 2 problems within an hour,
but made a mistake and B Large TLE-ed. That meant I had to do C. I was super
fixated on a binary search initially. I tried to build a tree data structure and
all. It took me awhile to build it, didn't revise it before hand. After
constructing it, I thought I was done, but it couldn't solve the 2nd small
dataset in time. After analyzing this in greater detail, I realized my
stupidity. You don't need a search! It can be computed with math. It's a pity I
didn't realize this earlier. I ended up finishing this at 9:30am, half an hour
before qualifications close. I'm pretty sure I nailed it because both small sets
were marked correct. 

I didn't sleep the whole night for this, short of some errands I had to run in
the middle of the night at 3am, because Dad was not feeling well. And then I
went for a McDonald's breakfast run :P

Coding while tired is really not ideal. Should start earlier! I tried the entire
Round 1 last year, but couldn't qualify for Top 3000. Always got stuck at
Question C. I have a feeling I won't make Top 3000 this year. I will aim to
reach Top 1000 next year and get my t-shirt.
