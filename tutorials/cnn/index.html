I found this really hard to understand. 2D Convolution was simple, but when I was trying to find out more about 3D Convolution, I couldn't get a good answer. Now that I know how it works, I would like to create a short tutorial with animations that would help people who are learning about CNNs. In progress. Coming your way!
