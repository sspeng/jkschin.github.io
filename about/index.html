I currently work at Palantir Technologies. I am a software engineer who has
experience with large scale data integration and analysis and machine learning.
I solve problems by first breaking it down, understanding the principles behind
the problem, and then prioritizing the most important sub-problems to solve.
When writing the solution, I do not believe in quick fixes and gravitate towards
writing clean maintainable code. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and
Software Engineering. I do more HackerRank nowadays (Project Euler on HackerRank
too), and occassionally read the latest research paper in top conferences.

<p>Cool stuff that I did:
	<ul>
        <li><a href="/2016/01/10/project-euler-541">51st person in the world to
                solve Project Euler Question 541.</a></li>
        <li><a href="/mountsutd">Naming a 6056m high unnamed and unclimbed
                mountain.</a></li>
        <li><a href="/ev">Built the fastest go-kart with a USD 500
