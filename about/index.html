<p>Hi there. I am Samuel. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Software
Engineering, Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. I enjoy solving interesting
problems of all scales and aspire to start a company in future. The views on
this website are solely my own and do not represent any of the organizations I
am in or have been in :)

                pioneer cohort of Entrepreneur First Singapore.</a></li>
