<p>Hi there. I am Samuel. I am interested in computer science and
entrepreneurship. I hope to use my skills in computer science to one day create
a business that will create an impact in this world. In the field of computer
science, my interests are in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and most
recently Natural Language Processing. With regards to Machine Learning,
specifically, Deep Learning. I am really interested to see how I can apply Deep
Learning to other fields and create meaningful contributions in those
fields.
