<p>Dear Google,</p>

<p>I am Samuel Chin, from Singapore. You can find all formal information about me from the resume, as such, here's my informal cover letter. I hope you will be convinced that I am a fit for the Google Brain Residency Program after reading this.</p>

<p>From your website, you mentioned about an ideal candidate. Let's see if I fit!</p>
<ol>
	<li class="google_li">A Bachelor's Degree, preferably in computer science, mathematics, or statistics.
		<ul>
			<li class="google_li">Check! It says Bachelor of Engineering on my transcript. However, I did a lot of CS modules. The projects had lots of design thinking involved too.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="google_li">Proficiency in programming and in the prerequisite courses. Here's the evidence!
		<ul>
			<li class="google_li">
				Transcript submitted. Evidence of lots of programming modules. In particular, I took two modules related to machine learning. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The AI project was to create an Othello AI. The ML project was to implement a HMM for POS tagging.</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				I do not have letters of recommendations. However, I applied to MIT IDM and received a conditional offer. My recommenders were Prof. Chong Tow Chong, Prof. Aditya Mathur, and Prof. Nils Ole Tippenhauer. My GRE score is 160 (verbal), 170 (quantitative), 5.5 (essay). I could send you the conditional offer letter if need be, but as for the recommendations, I do not have access to them. Trust that it will be good hehe ;)
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				Sadly, I have no notable performance in competitions. I didn't win any kaggle :( I will try some this year though!
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				I don't really have an open-source project that people use, but I would really love to contribute to tensorflow. I'm trying really hard now to figure out how to use it. I'm also trying my best to answer questions on stackoverflow.
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				I do however, do questions on an <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">open-source project</a>. I knew about it way back in 2012, but was re-introduced recently. My proudest achievement would be being the 53rd person to solve <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=541">Question 541</a>. Read about how we solved it <a href={% post_url 2016-01-10-project-euler-541 %}>here</a>. We because I collaborated with a friend. Credit is given where credit is due! We discussed the math but coded our own modules. If you're still unconvinced that I can do math and code, check out questions <a href="/euler/">100, 351, and 358!</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="google_li">
		A strong interest in the field, a commitment to detail, and a passion for deep learning.
		<ul>
			<li class="google_li">
				I don't have a publication :( I would love to publish though!
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				A commitment to detail. Building a working gokart under USD 500 is no mean feat. It requires, a commitment to detail. Check it out <a href="/ev/">here</a>!
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				I have <a href="/tensorflow/">blog posts</a> on TensorFlow! I know you're short of time, so I would recommend you read <a href={% post_url 2016-01-13-svhn-tensorflow %}>this</a>. Yes I did use the CIFAR10 code base, but I will re-implement my own version soon, in the hope of adding a Spatial Transformer Module too.
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				<p>The question of a novel learning algorithm is really hard. While trying out the SVHN data set, I realized that some numbers are tilted. But someone has done research on Spatial Transformer Networks already. I cropped my own data set of my numbers, and I wondered if we can do segmentation on neural nets. Once again, someone has done it. I really need to be at the cutting edge of things, so I can push the frontier of technology. I hope to be able to do this at Google. If I were to force out an idea of what I would want to try, it would be this.</p>

				<p>I don't have an implementation of it, but here's the idea. I intend to try it on the Wally concept. Given 100000 background images and 15 Wally images, can I train the net to be extremely good at recognizing clutter? Such that when I feed it a Wally image, it can tell me that it is not clutter.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="google_li">
				I read about deep learning stuff and use TensorFlow (I have tried both GPU and CPU installations) every day. I think TensorFlow is really cool because of two things. First, the ability to run CUDA code and CPU code with the SAME code. Unbelievable. I did some hardware projects before and more often than not, you have to specify the registers and stuff of those sorts. Second, the visualization tools are really useful. Having said all this, I believe it can be a lot better too! I want to be a main contributor. There are so many intricacies of TensorFlow that I do not understand.

</ol>

<p>
	Alright, having said all these, I would like to mention that I currently read papers every day and am working on both research and systems related projects. I hope this convinces you, but if it still does not, then read on!
</p>

<p>
	If there's anything I would brag about myself, I guess it would be that I am a very determined individual. When I was 13, I was forced to join competitive kayaking, because the school selected me based on a fitness test. I didn't really like it at first, but I fell in love with it. I was fortunate enough to be selected for the National Team at 15. I trained really hard. 12 times a week to be exact. From 5:30am to 7:30am in the morning, and 4:30pm to 7:30pm in the evening, Mondays to Saturdays, all while balancing school work.
</p>
<p>
	I stopped competitive kayaking at 18, because that was the age where I had to enlist in the army full-time. I was selected for Officer Cadet School, and I graduated 2nd in my cohort. I did well in army and I am projected to be the next Company Commander. I have also been appraised to assume higher appointments in future. Well, this is in my resume.
</p>
<p>
	In University, I started the <a href="/mountsutd/">mountaineering club</a> with Raymond. I had to motivate my team. I had to plan the training. I had to secure the funding. I had to meet the school management. I had to balance my academics. There were many other things I had to do. I'm glad I pulled it off, with the support of family and friends of course. Finally, I led all members with little or no experience in mountaineering, up a 19878 foot unnamed and unclimbed mountain. Every single person made it up.
</p>
<p>
	All I really want to say, is that I am very determined to join you at Google Brain. I will do my best to be more than prepared on 6th June 2016. Take a chance on me! Thank you for your time :)
